        <section class="simplicity">
            <h3>Simplicity and Ease of Learning</h3>
            <p>Esperanto was designed to be straightforward. Its grammar is logical, with no irregular verbs, and it’s phonetic, meaning words are pronounced just as they are written. Most learners can reach conversational proficiency within a few months. Key aspects that make it easy to learn include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regular Grammar:</strong> Esperanto has only 16 rules, all without exceptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Familiar Vocabulary:</strong> Many words are derived from common European languages, making them recognizable to many learners.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent Pronunciation:</strong> Each letter has a single sound, so there’s no guessing.</li>
            </ul>
